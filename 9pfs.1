.Ar mtpt
using the FUSE user-level file system driver.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Negotiate authentication using a local factotum. See
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
and
.Sx EXAMPLES
for more details.
.It Fl n
Do not negotiate authentication. This is the
default.
.It Fl U
Connect to a UNIX-domain
socket.
.It Fl p Ar port
Specifies the connection port for the 9P service.
The default is 564.
.It Fl u Ar user
Specifies the username to use on authentication
and attach to the 9P service.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width FACTOTUM
.It Ev FACTOTUM
Authentication requires that the 9P service
provided by a factotum
.Po see
.Lk http://man.cat-v.org/9front/4/factotum
.Pc
is mounted at the path specified by the
.Ev FACTOTUM
environment variable. Plan 9 from User Space
.Po
aka
.Lk https://swtch.com/plan9port/ plan9port
.Pc
provides a port of factotum to
UNIX-like operating systems.
See the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section below for details.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following will mount a remote 9P service
with authentication, so long as plan9port is
installed.
.Pp
.Dl $ factotum -n
.Dl $ 9pfs -U `namespace`/factotum mnt/factotum
.Dl $ export FACTOTUM=`pwd`/mnt/factotum
.Dl $ 9pfs -a spew.net mnt/spew
.Dl !adding key: role=client proto=p9sk1 dom=spew
.Dl user[glenda]:
.Dl password:
.Dl !

The utilities
.Ar factotum
and
.Ar namespace
are from Russ Cox's

.Sh BUGS
Files of 0 reported size are not read correctly under Linux. This
prevents 9pfs from mounting a useful factotum. For a
work-around, use 9pfuse to mount factotum and then proceed with
9pfs authentication as usual.
.Pp
OpenBSD does not display all the files in a very large
directory.
.Pp
Moving a file to a different directory is not implemented.
To do so, copy the file and then remove it.
